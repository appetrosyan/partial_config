error: Unnamed fields can't be named in configuration layers.

         = help: If the field is unnamed, I cannot find a consistent way of naming them in configuration layers, because they muse be human facing. You are probably applying this derive macro to a tuple structure, which is not a sensible input.

error: Unit fields cannot be named.

         = help: If the field is unnamed, I cannot find a consistent way of naming them in configuration layers. Add a dummy field with e.g. `PhantomData` to silence this error.

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `HasPartial` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
